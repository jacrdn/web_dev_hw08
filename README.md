# BLAZENEU - 

## Success, not drug tests
We want you to be as prepared as possible.
Know what to expect, before you get to the interview.


## The BLAZE NEU team does not encourage or condone the use of recreational drugs, which may violate aspects of the Northeastern University Code of Student Conduct.

## It is our belief that transpareny in employment screening is mutually beneficial for students and employers.

## This website exists to improve that transparency.

## Includes code from and based on Prof Tuck's in-class PhotoBlog example.
