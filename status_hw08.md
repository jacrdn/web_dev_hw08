Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Jack Cardin

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/jacrdn/web_dev_hw08


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

events.jacrdn.com

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

the only thing missing is new responses overriding old ones. additionally there is no summary e.x "3 yes, 2 no, 1 maybe" as this didn't fit in with the design decisions i made when creating responses.

**overall the app functions as follows.**

user goes to the site,

- must create a user to make events
- is prompted after to login (by email)

after a user is logged in they can acess and delete their profile or go back to the home page with the event feed

- the event feed shows all posts they've made and been invited to

a user can make an event

- a user makes an event just like in hw07

- users can comment, and delete comments if they're their own 
- or if you are the creator of the post you can delete anyones comment

- if you're the post owner you can invite people by putting in the email address
- (then if a user is logged in with said email that event will be displayed in their event feed)

- invitees can make responses on events (which work essentially the same as comments)

- if a user goes to the site by link:
- they'll be prompted to login
- if they're logged in an not invited they wont see any of the event details and will have to press the home button to exit
- otherwise the event should then appear in their feed


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

yes my app is properly deployed.
